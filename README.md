# 🧠 MNIST Digit Classifier

This project demonstrates handwritten digit recognition using two machine learning approaches:

- ✅ MLPClassifier from scikit-learn
- ✅ Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras & TensorFlow

The models are trained on the MNIST dataset (28x28 grayscale images) to classify digits from 0 to 9.

## 📊 Model Performance

| Model         | Validation Accuracy |
|---------------|----------------------|
| MLPClassifier |        96.00%        |
| CNN (Keras)   |        98.74%        |

📊 Comparison

- The CNN model achieved higher validation accuracy and is better suited for image classification.
- The MLPClassifier offers a simpler pipeline but performs slightly lower on visual tasks.
